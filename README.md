# OCR-Web-App

## Project Description: OCR Web App

This web application utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from images. Users can upload an image containing text, and the application will use the Tesseract.js library to recognize and display the extracted text on the screen. Additionally, users have the option to copy the recognized text to the clipboard and edit it as needed. The application also provides a zoom function to facilitate viewing of the image. With a simple interface and useful features, this application makes text extraction from images quick and convenient.
